# Using this file
1) This requires a [Google Address Validation key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/address-validation/get-api-key). This file expects a file named "apikeys.csv" formatted as "address_key,apikey", placed in the same directory as the XLSM.
2) When validating addresses, I recommend using this [Google Address Validation demo](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/address-validation/demo)
